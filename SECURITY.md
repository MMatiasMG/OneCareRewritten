## Reporting a Vulnerability

It should go without saying that running this product alone is a security vulnerability. Windows Live OneCare hasn't been (and won't receive) updates for years.
Please do not report issues about OneCare running outdated Virus signatures, nothing can be done about this. Modern MPAM-FE's no longer respond to the relevant
arguments instructing updates to OneCare.

If you find a serious vulnerability with the installer itself, please log this under Discussions or Issues so this can be looked into.
