# OneCareRewritten
<h3>OneCare Rewritten</h3>
<p>This is a dirty upload of the OneCare Rewritten project which can be found at https://onecare.cloudlillith.net. <br> This means that I've
yet to finalise the code. It's messy and dirty but currently works mostly.</p>
<h3>What does this do?</h3>
<p>This tool allows users of existing Windows Live OneCare medium to install it as normal.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The official setup file that comes on the OneCare discs attempts to reach Microsoft servers that no longer exist to download additional setup packages.</p>
<p>This bypasses this step by only installing whats on your current disc.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>OneCare setup ISO or disc mounted, both versions of the disc will work, this app will auto detect which version you have.</p>
<h3>Supported OSes</h3>
<p>Windows Vista (Any edition) 32-Bit</p>
<p>Windows Vista (Any edition) 64-Bit</p>
<p>Windows XP is currently in-development. The installer on here won't accept it, likewise for Server 2008/r2. If anyone has an image of OneCare for Server, please let me know so I can look at adding support for this. XP support will be implemented at a future date.</p>
<h3>Project Properties</h3>
<p>Platform: x86/32-Bit</p>
<p>Targetting Framework: .net 4.0</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2019 Community (2022 doesn't support legacy .net versions natively)</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why isn't it themed like the original installer?</h3>
<p>I don't want an IP lawsuit. Microsoft own the original setup materials and explicitly state that the installer and it's contents are not to be redistributed
or modified in any form. This installer is built ground up and only designed to look similar to the original installer.</p>
<h3>Can I install OneCare without a disc or install media?</h3>
<p>No, for me to add support to that would be piracy. Buy a disc off eBay if you're interested.</p>
<h3>Is Windows 8/10/11 supported?</h3>
<p>No, and it never will be for that matter of fact. This software is old and the installer is buitl soley for use on Vista-era machines for people
who want a somewhat authentic installation experience or to re-experience the blast from the past, OneCare.</p>

<p>Big thank-you to MJD and Archive.Org for providing materials for me to create this.</p>
